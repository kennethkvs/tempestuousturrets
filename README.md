# Tempestuous Turrets

A fun 4 player local co-op game that can be played with just one button per player. The simple controls allow for it to be an easy pick-up-and-play kind of game that anyone can learn, however, the gameplay elements and variety of maps with varying elements makes it one that is diffcult to master, are you ready to face off against your friends and/or family to find out how is the most tempestuous turret?

Made with dedication, sleep deprivation, and Monster energy drink in Hack The North 2022.

The website runs the game well and gives you a chance to play it, but for an even better experience, we high recommend that you download the game on your local machine. NOTE: To download it and play it, it is critical you have Unity installed along the corresponding environment set up and ready to go.
